# Philosophy and Ethics
The goal of The Anadromi Project is not to teach programming but computer science. The distinction lies in the active thinking, similar to the difference between a code monkey and a software engineer or a script kiddie and a hacker. It's not the code that makes the difference between the two—it's the person who writes it. Anadromi will focus on the theoretical component at the beginning of each module and at the end, there will be a practical application, where you write the code yourself. This allows for trial-and-error, the age-old proven method of becoming good at anything.

In ethics, there is very little that can violated for an open-sourced project such as this. Of course, slander will be discouraged, but this is the Internet so there is no easy deterrence, though that is small matter. Something Anadromi, like all computer science education programs, worries about is academic honesty. There is no way we can tell whether you actually wrote the code or if you just copied it after a quick Google search. Heck, the solutions to each problem is included in their respective repository (though with detailed comments, which can be useful if you're stuck). The temptation to cheat will always be there—Anadromi relies on the temptation to learn.
