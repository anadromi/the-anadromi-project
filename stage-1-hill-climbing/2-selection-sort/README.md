If I gave you a list of unordered numbers like here, how would you sort it?

[6, 7, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8]

For a list this short, we can simply glance and laugh and picture it sorted: it's just 1 to 9. But computers don't have the same cognitive powers we do and for larger lists, the *simply look at it and figure it out* algorithm won't work. The computer must be given a set of steps it can carry out in order to sort the list. For this lesson, these steps are called selection sort.
