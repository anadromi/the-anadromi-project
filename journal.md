Started working on actual lessons. Will figure out tests later. Finished

Weird error bugged me all morning with pytest. Apparently test function names must be start with ```test_``` such as 
``` python
def test_simple():
    assert(1) = 1
```
Otherwise pytest won't work. Understood makefiles better today. --verbose and --disable-pytest-warnings are useful. There are other flags too. Got tests to continue after failure. Unfortunately, they don't provide enough information. Will have to look for another way. Wrote a rough intro to GitHub and C9. Gotta come back and add screenshots.

## Tuesday July 25
Wrote my own test. Works well so far. So far, it's written for selection sort but I will make a general template. Will finish as many lessons as possible today. Gonna have to work on some at home or bring my laptop (not sure how to screenshot on these computers).
