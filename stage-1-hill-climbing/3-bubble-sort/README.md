## Key Words
#### Element
An item inside a list. In the list ```[1, 2, 3]``` 1, 2, and 3 are all elements.

#### Increment
Adding a fixed number consistently. Opposite is decrement. Unlike C-based languages, Python does not suppose the ```++``` short hand to have variables increment by 1, so ```+= 1``` is used instead.

#### Index
The index is the *numerical position* of an element inside a list. This is important for tracking the location of a specific element. The numbering system is slightly convoluted since, programmers count starting from zero (because it's slightly more efficent), so each number is one less than what we would normally call it in real life. In ```[1, 2, 3]```, 1 may seem like the first element, but it is actually the zeroth. 2 would be the first and 3 is the second. So to match the index with each element, it would look like 0:1, 1:2, and 2:3.

#### Insert
This isn't so much a definition as it is an explanation of the ```insert()``` function. It takes the an index and an element, and it inserts the entered element at the position of the entered index pushes everything back.
```python
ls = [1, 2, 3]
ls.insert(0, 0)
print(ls) #will print [0, 1, 2, 3]
```
Be careful you don't set ```ls``` to ```ls.insert(0, 0)```. That would change ```ls``` to ```None```.

#### Iterate
Repeating a process for each element until a condition has been reached in which case it is stopped. For linear search, the process will be comparing the element with the number we are trying to locate.

#### List
A list is just a collection of numbers. This collection can contain however many numbers and each number can be of any value (we shouldn't have to worry about going over the maximum size of a list or the maximum value of a number in the scope of this lesson). For example ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` is a list and ```[10, 4, 5, 9.5, 4, 5.4]``` is another. Heck, it can even include strings (text). ```[1, 2, 'three']``` is a totally valid list. 

In some other languages, it is referred to as an *array*.

#### Return
This will give back a certain value and end the function process. For example:
```python
def giveThree():
  return 3

three = giveThree()
```
Now the variable ```three``` has been assigned the value of 3. As you can see, this is pretty useless because we could've given ```three``` the value directly instead of making a function return it, but when there is an actually something going on inside the function, returning values becomes much more... *valuable*.
