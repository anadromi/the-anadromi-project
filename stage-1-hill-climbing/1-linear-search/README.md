# Linear Search

## Introduction

Suppose I had a collection of numbers, which we'll call a [*list*](list "collection of numbers"), how would I find a specific [*element*](element "just an item") in that list? 

Let's take the list ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` and let's say I wanted to find the [*index*](index "position in list") of the number 3. Asking for the index will be the same as asking what the numerical position of the element. 




## Key words
#### List
A list is just a collection of numbers. This collection can contain however many numbers and each number can be of any value (we shouldn't have to worry about going over the maximum size of a list or the maximum value of a number in the scope of this lesson). For example ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` is a list and ```[10, 4, 5, 9.5, 4, 5.4]``` is another. Heck, it can even include strings (text). ```[1, 2, 'three']``` is a totally valid list. 

In some other languages, it is referred to as an *array*.

#### Element
An item inside a list. In the list ```[1, 2, 3]``` 1, 2, and 3 are all elements.

#### Index
The numerical position of an element inside a list. Programmers count starting from zero (because it's slightly more efficent), so each number is one less than what we would normally call it in real life. In ```[1, 2, 3]```, 1 may seem like the first element, but it is actually the zeroth. 2 would be the first and 3 is the second. So to match the index with each element, it would look like 0:1, 1:2, and 2:3. If I wanted the element 2, I would need to refer to it as [1].
