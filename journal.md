Started working on actual lessons. Will figure out tests later.

Weird error bugged me all morning with pytest. Apparently test function names must be start with ```test_``` such as 
``` python
def test_simple():
    assert(1) = 1
```
Otherwise pytest won't work. Understood makefiles better. You can call commands with specific flags.
