# Linear Search

## Introduction

Suppose I had a collection of numbers, which we'll call a *list*, how would I find a specific item in that list? This list can contain however many numbers and each number can be of any arbitrary value. For example ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` is a list. ```[10, 4, 5, 9.5, 4, 5.4]``` works as well.

Taking ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]```, let's return to the problem: finding the index of a specific element.
