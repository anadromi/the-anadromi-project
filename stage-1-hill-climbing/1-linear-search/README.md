## Introduction
Suppose I had a collection of numbers, which we'll call a [*list*](#list "collection of numbers") and I wanted to find a specific [*element*](element "just an item") in that list. Well, linear search can help us out. Finding and matching values is extremely important in daily life, whether you're doing a Google search or ```ctrl + f``` in a doc or looking up values for your company, searching is necessary. Even though most of these examples involve searching strings (text), for the sake of abstraction, we will be searching in lists of numbers for numbers. Replacing the numbers with strings will make no difference to linear search. Let's go implement our first algorithm that can search through a list!

## Theory
Let's take the list ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` and let's say I wanted to find the [*index*](#index "position in list") of the number 3. The way the linear search algorithm works is that it will compare the number we are looking for with every element in the list, starting from the beginning. 

First, it would compare 3 with 1. 

They're not equal, so we move on to 2. 3 doesn't equal 2, so we move on again. 

Now we have reached 3 and 3—they match and we [*return*](#return "give back") the index. 

If by the end, there has been no matches, just return -1. That's all there is to it!

## Pseudocode
Of course, we have to code it. Here, I'll present the pseudocode, a made up language for the purpose of applying the theory to  implement a linear search. 
```
linear_search(ls, num)
    index variable set to 0
    for every item in ls
            check it
```
We need an ```index``` variable in order to keep track of where we are. This variable should [*increment*](#increment "Add consistenly by the number") by 1 as we pass through the list. This index is what the function will return once we find the number. 

Next is the for loop. We need this is [*iterate*](#iterate "go over each") through the list that is given. It allows the function to check every element. Each will be compared to num, which is the number we are looking for. So this is how we "check it".
```
linear_search(ls, num)
    index variable set to 0
    for every item in ls
        if this item equals num
            give back the index and stop the loop
```
Luckily for us, ```return index``` will give back the index AND stops the loop at the same (once ```return``` statements run, the function is exited). The algorithm is almost complete—we just need to return -1 if there is no match at all.

```
linear_search(ls, num)
    index variable set to 0
    for every item in ls
        if this item equals num
            give back the index and stop the loop
        index add one
    give back -1
```
Here, notice that the ```give back -1``` is not included in the loop (notice the indentation levels). If it was in the loop, the loop would end after one iteration and just ```return -1```. By having it outside of loop, we are certain it will run **after** the entire list has been iterated over already.

There is another, more sophisticated way to implement this that uses ```for i in range(len(ls))``` (Python spoilers) where you won't need a variable to keep track of the index. That's for you to figure out ;).

## Analysis
So linear search is definitely no the most efficent way to search for an element. Sure, maybe if you're lucky, the very first element you check will turn out to be the one you're looking for and it's done. Boom. One step. But the element you're searching for is at the end, then you'll be checking **every** element along the way. Sure that may not be bad with the lists we're dealing with here. But as these lists get larger and larger, checking every element will slow the program down by a large margin. 

If you've looked into the next stage, you'll find that we'll be covering binary search, which is a much more efficent, faster, and smarter searching algorithm. However, the downside to binay search is that the list it searches must be sorted (```[1,2,3]``` is sorted but ```[2,1,3]``` is not). And wow, our next lesson is selection sort, another simple algorithm.

## Key words
#### Element
An item inside a list. In the list ```[1, 2, 3]``` 1, 2, and 3 are all elements.

#### List
A list is just a collection of numbers. This collection can contain however many numbers and each number can be of any value (we shouldn't have to worry about going over the maximum size of a list or the maximum value of a number in the scope of this lesson). For example ```[1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]``` is a list and ```[10, 4, 5, 9.5, 4, 5.4]``` is another. Heck, it can even include strings (text). ```[1, 2, 'three']``` is a totally valid list. 

In some other languages, it is referred to as an *array*.

#### Increment
Adding a fixed number consistently. Opposite is decrement. Unlike C-based languages, Python does not suppose the ```++``` short hand to have variables increment by 1, so ```+= 1``` is used instead.

#### Index
The index is the *numerical position* of an element inside a list. Programmers count starting from zero (because it's slightly more efficent), so each number is one less than what we would normally call it in real life. In ```[1, 2, 3]```, 1 may seem like the first element, but it is actually the zeroth. 2 would be the first and 3 is the second. So to match the index with each element, it would look like 0:1, 1:2, and 2:3.

#### Iterate
Repeating a process for each element until a condition has been reached in which case it is stopped. For linear search, the process will be comparing the element with the number we are trying to locate.

#### Return
This will give back a certain value and end the function process. For example:
```python
def giveThree():
  return 3

three = giveThree()
```
Now the variable ```three``` has been assigned the value of 3. As you can see, this is pretty useless because we could've given ```three``` the value directly instead of making a function return it, but when there is an actually something going on inside the function, returning values becomes much more... *valuable*.
